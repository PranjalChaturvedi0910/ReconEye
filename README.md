# ReconEye: AI-Powered Body-Worn Surveillance System

## Overview
ReconEye is a demonstration of an AI-powered surveillance system designed for body-worn cameras. It showcases how computer vision, edge AI, and deep learning can be applied for real-time detection and recognition in security applications.

Key features include:
- Face detection and recognition
- Threat analysis and detection
- Automated alert system
- Visual feedback with color-coded identification

## Disclaimer
This is a **proof of concept** for educational purposes only. Deployment of surveillance systems requires careful consideration of privacy laws, ethical guidelines, and regulatory compliance. This code should not be used in production environments without proper legal and ethical review.

## Prerequisites
- Google Colab account
- Basic knowledge of Python
- Test images for processing

## Getting Started

### Running on Google Colab
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Create a new notebook
3. Copy the code blocks from the provided script into separate cells
4. Run each block in sequence (Block 1 â†’ Block 8)

### Installation Process
The code automatically installs all required libraries:
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Requests
- Matplotlib

## How It Works

### System Components
1. **Face Detection**: Uses OpenCV's DNN module with a pre-trained Caffe model
2. **Face Recognition**: Simplified implementation using MobileNetV2 architecture
3. **Threat Detection**: Custom classifier based on MobileNetV2
4. **Alert System**: Simulation of notification dispatch

### Visual Indicators
- **Green**: Unknown person
- **Yellow**: Known individual with normal threat level
- **Red**: High-threat individual or wanted person

## Usage
The system offers two ways to process images:

### Option 1: Upload Your Own Image
Run Block 7 to upload an image from your computer. The system will process it and display the results.

### Option 2: Use Sample Image
Uncomment and run Block 8 to download and process a sample image.

## Limitations
- This is a simplified demonstration, not a production-ready system
- Models are not truly trained - they use pre-trained weights without specific fine-tuning
- Face recognition uses simulated face embeddings
- Processing occurs in the cloud rather than on an edge device
- No real-time video processing in the Colab environment

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for a real deployment could include:
- Custom model training for higher accuracy
- Optimization for edge devices
- Enhanced privacy protections
- Real-time video processing
- Secure communication protocols
- Integration with actual law enforcement databases

## Ethics and Privacy
Implementation of systems like ReconEye raises important questions about:
- Public surveillance and privacy
- Facial recognition accuracy and bias
- Data security and storage
- Appropriate use of alerts and notifications

Any real-world deployment should include thorough ethical review, stakeholder input, and compliance with local laws and regulations.
